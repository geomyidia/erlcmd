*A MIDI CLI tool and server written in Go, focused on supporting BEAM music apps via Erlang Ports*

## About

The executable built by this project is intended to:
* communicate via messages with BEAM (Erlang language family) clients
* to do so with messages created by [midilib](https://github.com/erlsci/midilib)
* to be controlled by a `gen_server` (e.g., see [undermidi go server](https://github.com/ut-proj/undermidi/blob/release/0.2.x/src/undermidi/supervisor.lfe))
* to be run as part of a supervision tree (e.g., see [undermidi supervisor](https://github.com/ut-proj/undermidi))

## Usage

A typical execution looks like this:

```shell
$ ./bin/midiserver -d -l warn -p exec
```

You can use it to test your MIDI setup:

```shell
$ ./bin/midiserver list-devices
$ ./bin/midiserver example 0 0
```

Full usage:

```shell
$ ./bin/midiserver -h
```

```text
Usage: ./bin/midiserver [flags] [commands] [args]

Flags:

  -d	Daemonise midiserver; this disables the text parser; short-form flag
  -daemon
    	Daemonise midiserver; this disables the text parser
  -epmd-host string
    	Set hostname of the epmd to use (default "localhost")
  -epmd-port int
    	Set port for the epmd to use (default 4369)
  -ergo.norecover
    	disable panic catching
  -ergo.trace
    	enable extended debug info
  -i int
    	This needs to be a valid ID for a MIDI device capable of receiving
    	MIDI data; for a list of valid IDs be sure to run the 'list-devices'
    	command; short-form flag (default -1)
  -l string
    	Set the logging level; short-form flag (default "warn")
  -log-reportcaller
    	Indicate whether the log lines contain the report caller
  -loglevel string
    	Set the logging level (default "warn")
  -midi-in int
    	This needs to be a valid ID for a MIDI device capable of receiving
    	MIDI data; for a list of valid IDs be sure to run the 'list-devices'
    	command (default -1)
  -n string
    	Set the Erlang node name for remote communications; short-form flag
  -p string
    	Set the parser to user for commands and data. Legal values are:
    	[exec, port, text]. Note that setting to 'text' disables
    	daemonisation and setting any of the other parsers automatically
    	enables daemonisation; short-form flag (default "text")
  -parser string
    	Set the parser to user for commands and data. Legal values are:
    	[exec, port, text]. Note that setting to 'text' disables
    	daemonisation and setting any of the other parsers automatically
    	enables daemonisation (default "text")
  -r	Indicate whether the log lines contain the report caller; short-form flag
  -remote-module string
    	Set the Erlang module for remote communications
  -remote-node string
    	Set the Erlang node name for remote communications
  -v	Display version/build info and exit; short-form flag
  -version
    	Display version/build info and exit

Commands:

  example [args]
      An example piece of music will be played on given device and channel.
      Valid device numbers are any of the "out" devices in the output of
      the 'list-devices' command; valid channel numbers are any of the 16
      MIDI channels: 0 through 15.
  list-devices
      This will list the MIDI devices currently recognised by the operating
      system, grouped by input devices and output devices.
  play-note [args]
      A pitch will be played with the default values for the arguments,
      opertionally overridden. Positional args are the integer values for
      device, channel, pitch, velocity, and duration.  Valid device numbers
      are any of the "out" devices in the output of the 'list-devices'
      command; valid channel numbers are any of the 16 MIDI channels:
      0 through 15. Pitch and velocity are standard MIDI integer values for
      the same. Duration is in seconds.
  ping
      Provided for testing purposes by Erlang Ports implementations. If the
      'remote-module' flag has been set, a ping will be attempted there
      instead.
  remote-port
      Query epmd for the port of the remote node (set with the -remote-node
      flag).
  version
      An alternate form of the version info with concise formatting.
```
